<h2>Cricket Scoreboard</h2>
This is my first academic capstone project. This project has two programs, one shows the scoreboard while the other one is used to control the match.
<h3>Manager</h3>
Manager program has a authentication system which is required to start and operate a match. After login you have to enter necessary information to start the match. Now you just have to enter the scores in every ball to see results in scoreboard.

<h3>Scoreboard</h3>
Scoreboard program shows you the scoreboard while the match is running otherwise it will show "No match is running". This program is only to see the scoreboard. You can enter the program before the match started then just enjoy the match.
